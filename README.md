## Dev Setup

As we are using Nix in this project, there is no need to install Python or any other dependencies. You will get everything you need within seconds out of the box. Also there is no need to create a virtual environment in Python using `venv` or `poetry`. You just need to be willing to install Nix on your system.

- Install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- Install [Lix](https://lix.systems/install/)
- Clone this repository
- cd into the directory
- Run `direnv allow`
- Run `pytest`
