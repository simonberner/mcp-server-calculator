# How to build an MCP server - Calculator Example

⚠️ work in progress ⚠️

## About

> "MCP can provide a single, standardized way for AI models to interact with external systems. You write code once and all AI systems can use it." [1](#resources)

### Server

> "Servers are the fundamental building block that enriches LLMs with external data and context." [2](#resources)

## Usage

🚧 TODO

- MCP Inspector is a handy GUI tool that lets you test your custom MCP server without integrating it with LLM / AI agents.

```shell
mcp dev src/mcp_server_calculator/calculator.py
```

### Notes

- When using [Windsurf IDE](https://codeium.com/windsurf) as MCP Client, you need to have an [Pro Plan](https://codeium.com/pricing) to be able to use MCP Servers.

## Dev Setup

As we are using Nix in this project for having a reproducible and isolated development environment, there is no need to install Python or any other dependencies. You will get everything you need out of the box. Also there is no need to create a virtual environment in Python using `venv` or `poetry`, but you have to be willing to install Nix on your system.

- Install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- Install [Lix](https://lix.systems/install/)
- Clone this repository
- cd into the directory
- Run `direnv allow`
- Run `pytest`

That's it!

### Tech Stack

- Python3
- Pytest
- MCP SDK
- MCP CLI
- Nix
